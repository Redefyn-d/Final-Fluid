## ℹ️ Overview

**Final-Fluid** acts as the central interface for **River AI**, connecting IoT-enabled water sensors to a user-friendly monitoring and reporting platform. The system continuously tracks various water parameters — such as **pH**, **turbidity**, **temperature**, and **dissolved oxygen** — and notifies authorities or environmental analysts when contamination levels exceed established safety thresholds.
